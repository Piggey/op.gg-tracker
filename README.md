# op.gg tracker using python (useful for streamers)

### this script requires beautifulsoup4 in order for it to work!
> pip install beautifulsoup4
I don't know how to make setup.py so you have to do it manually lol

## How does it work?
It automatically outputs your win/loss ratio and current league and LP to a file so you can add it in OBS.
In order for this to work, you need to:
1. paste the op.gg link to account you want to track (for example: https://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=User_name)
2. set up the current win/loss ratio you have (if it's a fresh start just type '0')
3. Interval between tracking (in minutes)
